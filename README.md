### Overview
This research was conducted during the SPICE Summer Program 2023. Supported by the [Pacific Intelligence Innovation Initiative](https://hawaiip3i.org/), three students were introduced to the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the lense of climate change. 

*What is NLP?*
- The [IBM Think](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) definition: Natural language processing, or NLP, combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical and machine learning models to enable computers and digital devices to recognize, understand and generate text and speech.

### Research Scope
Students began by reading the *Nature* paper [Computer-assisted classification of contrarian claims about climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01714-4#data-availability)
- Then, students forked the [papers github repository](https://github.com/traviscoan/cards) to acceess the data and code 
- Next, students performed network analysis utilizing the [quanteda r package](https://quanteda.io/) and created word clouds to further understand the linguistical patterns around each of the climate contrarian "super claims"
- After gathering this understanding, students performed sentiment analysis utilizing the [EmoRoberta Model](https://huggingface.co/arpanghoshal/EmoRoBERTa) from hugging face (the most recent and powerful model in NLP that can detect up to 28 emotions) 
- Lastly, the team explored what it's like to train a classification model by diving into the training and testing code behind [ClimateBert](https://www.chatclimate.ai/climatebert)
